## Overview

DevConnector is a full-stack social network for developers. It lets users build a professional profile, share posts, and connect with other engineers in a clean, modern web experience.

## Key Features

- **JWT authentication** with protected routes.
- **Developer profiles** with skills, bio, location, and social links.
- **Experience and education** management.
- **Community posts** with likes and comments.
- **Profile discovery** with public profile pages.
- **GitHub integration** to surface recent repositories.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**, **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, **Tailwind CSS**
- **Node.js**, **Express**, **Express Validator**
- **MongoDB**, **Mongoose**
- **Axios**, **date-fns**, **Gravatar**, **JWT**

## Why It Stands Out

- Clear separation between API and client UI.
- Real-world user flows for auth, profiles, and community content.
- Strong foundation for scaling into a hiring or networking platform.
